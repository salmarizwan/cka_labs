# Environment Setup

This section documents the complete lab environment used for all CKA exercises in this repository.

The goal of this setup is to closely resemble a **real-world Kubernetes administration environment**, while remaining lightweight and exam-focused.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Build a reproducible Kubernetes lab
- Practice cluster administration using kubeadm
- Simulate real troubleshooting scenarios
- Prepare for CKA-style time-bound tasks

---

## 📂 Contents

- `cluster-architecture.md` – Cluster topology and node roles
- `vmware-setup.md` – Virtual machine configuration
- `networking-design.md` – Networking and IP planning
- `tools-installation.md` – Required tools and versions

---

## ⚠️ Important

All configuration decisions are intentional and documented.
This is not a “click-next” setup.
